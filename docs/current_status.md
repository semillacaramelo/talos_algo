# Talos Algo Trading Bot - Current Status

## Project Overview
The Talos Algo Trading Bot is an algorithmic trading application designed to automate trading on the Deriv platform. The bot implements machine learning-based signal generation, integrates with the official Deriv API, and provides a web interface for monitoring and control.

## Core Components
1. **API Integration** (`src/api/deriv_api_handler.py`): A wrapper for the official Deriv API library with connection management, authentication, and subscription handling.
2. **Trading Logic** (`src/trading/trading_logic.py`): Implements core trading execution, position sizing, and validation logic.
3. **ML Model** (`src/models/signal_model.py`): Handles signal generation using a machine learning model for trading decisions.
4. **Data Handling** (`src/data/data_handler.py`): Manages historical data fetching and real-time data processing.
5. **Web Interface** (`app.py`): Flask-based web control panel for monitoring and controlling the trading bot.

## Recent Changes
1. **Asynchronous Callback Handling**: Fixed the critical issue with async callbacks in ReactiveX subscriptions by implementing wrapper functions that properly schedule async tasks in the event loop.
2. **API Integration**: Complete implementation of the official python-deriv-api library from GitHub.
3. **Subscription Management**: Proper cleanup of tick and contract subscriptions.
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling across the application.
5. **Modular Architecture**: Reorganized code into a cleaner module structure.

## Current Capabilities
1. **Authentication**: Securely authenticates with the Deriv API using the API token from environment variables.
2. **Real-time Data**: Successfully subscribes to and processes real-time tick data.
3. **Trading Signals**: Generates trading signals using a machine learning model.
4. **Contract Execution**: Places trades (binary options) based on generated signals.
5. **Contract Monitoring**: Monitors and tracks the status of active contracts.
6. **Web Control Panel**: Provides a web interface to start/stop the bot and view logs.

## Known Issues and Limitations
1. **Model Performance**: Current ML model is a basic implementation and requires optimization.
2. **Error Resilience**: Need more comprehensive error handling for network failures.
3. **Reconnection Strategy**: Missing automatic reconnection for API connection drops.
4. **Risk Management**: Limited implementation of advanced risk management features.
5. **Testing Coverage**: Many tests are currently skipped and need proper implementation.

## Next Steps
1. **Risk Management**: Implement proper position sizing, daily loss limits, and maximum drawdown protection.
2. **Reliability**: Add automatic reconnection, improved error handling, and circuit breakers.
3. **Model Improvements**: Enhance the ML model with better feature engineering and model management.
4. **Testing**: Complete implementation of missing tests and improve test coverage.
5. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive API documentation and usage examples.

## Recent Fixes
1. **Asynchronous Callbacks**: Fixed the issue with async callbacks in ReactiveX subscriptions.
2. **Contract Updates**: Implemented proper handling of contract updates.
3. **Reactive Subscriptions**: Improved subscription management and cleanup.
4. **Model Loading**: Added fallback mechanisms for model loading.
5. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling throughout the application.
