**Rapid Deployment Project Plan** for the Deriv AI Bot MVP

1.  **Phase 1: Blueprint & Idea:** First, we figure out the simplest possible trading idea (like following a basic signal) for just one or two specific things on Deriv (like EUR/USD). We also find our "password" (API Key) from Deriv for the practice account (demo account).
2.  **Phase 2: Get Your Workshop Ready:** We gather our tools (Python and helpful libraries like `requests` for talking to Deriv and `scikit-learn` for the simple 'AI brain') and set up our computer space, including a 'virtual workbench' (the VPS) where the bot will eventually run 24/7. We also start using Git to save our progress, like taking snapshots of our work.
3.  **Phase 3: Build the Core Machine:** This is where we build the main parts:
    *   The **Connector:** Little functions to talk to Deriv (get price, place trade, check account).
    *   The **Data Handler:** Gets the market info needed.
    *   The **Signal Brain:** Implements our simple trading idea (maybe using that basic `scikit-learn` model).
    *   The **Trading Logic:** The main loop that connects everything: gets data -> asks the brain -> checks safety rules -> tells the Connector to trade.
    *   **Safety Net:** Simple, hard rules like 'never risk too much' and 'always have an escape plan' (stop-loss).
    *   **Logbook:** Keep detailed notes of everything the bot does.
4.  **Phase 4: Practice Run:** We run the bot using the **Demo Account** (like a simulator). This is super important to make sure it works correctly without risking real money. We watch it closely.
5.  **Phase 5: First Steps in Real World:** *Only* if the practice run goes well, we switch to the **Live Account** but use the smallest possible trade size. The goal isn't profit yet, just confirming it works technically with real money involved.
6.  **Phase 6: Watch & Tune:** We keep a close eye on the live bot, fix any hiccups, and *maybe* make small, careful improvements over time based on what we see.

The whole point is to get a *basic version working quickly and safely*, focusing on that core loop: **Data -> Signal -> Risk Check -> Trade**.
