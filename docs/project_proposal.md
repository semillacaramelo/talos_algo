**Disclaimer:** Trading involves significant risk, and automated trading, especially with AI, does not guarantee profits. Losses can exceed deposits. This plan is for informational purposes; ensure you understand the risks, Deriv's terms, and relevant regulations before proceeding. Start with thorough testing on a demo account and use real money cautiously only if you fully accept the risks.

**Goal:** Deploy a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) AI trading bot on Deriv.com quickly, focusing on core functionality and safety.

**Phase 1: Planning & Strategy Definition (Focus: Simplicity for Speed)**

1.  **Define Clear Objective:**
    *   What is the *simplest* measurable goal? (e.g., execute trades based on a basic indicator crossover, achieve a small target profit percentage on demo).
    *   Avoid overly complex profit targets or strategies initially.
2.  **Select Instrument(s):**
    *   Choose 1-2 liquid instruments on Deriv with good API data availability (e.g., a major Forex pair like EUR/USD or a specific Volatility Index). Start simple.
3.  **Choose a *Simple* AI/Trading Strategy:**
    *   **For Speed:** Instead of complex Deep Learning initially, consider:
        *   **Rule-Based System with ML Optimization:** Use classic indicators (MACD, RSI, Moving Averages) for entry/exit signals, but use a simple ML model (like Logistic Regression or a Decision Tree) trained on historical data to *confirm* or *filter* these signals. This is faster to implement than end-to-end deep learning.
        *   **Basic Pattern Recognition:** Train a simple model to recognize basic chart patterns preceding price movements.
    *   Define strict entry/exit rules and risk parameters (stop-loss, take-profit, position size). **Crucially, keep these simple for the MVP.**
4.  **Deriv.com API Familiarization:**
    *   Sign up for a Deriv demo account.
    *   Obtain API keys for the demo account.
    *   Review the Deriv API documentation thoroughly: focus on authentication, retrieving market data (ticks/candles), placing orders (market/limit), checking account status, and managing open positions.
    *   Identify necessary API endpoints *specifically* for your simple strategy.

**Phase 2: Tech Stack & Environment Setup (Focus: Standard Tools)**

1.  **Language & Libraries:**
    *   **Python:** Standard choice due to libraries.
    *   `requests` or `websockets`: For interacting with Deriv API (check if they offer WebSocket for real-time data).
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation.
    *   `numpy`: For numerical operations.
    *   `scikit-learn`: For simple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees). Avoid heavy frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch for the *initial* fast deployment unless absolutely necessary for the *chosen* simple strategy.
    *   `schedule` or `APScheduler`: For scheduling tasks (e.g., check signals every minute).
2.  **Environment:**
    *   **Local Development:** Set up Python environment (e.g., using `venv`).
    *   **Deployment Server (MVP):** Start with a reliable Cloud VPS (Virtual Private Server - e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, Vultr). A basic tier is enough initially. Choose a server location geographically close to Deriv's servers if possible (check their documentation or support for hints) to reduce latency.
    *   **Alternative (Consider if meets needs):** Check Deriv's own automation tools like DBot or Binary Bot. They might offer faster *visual* setup for *very simple* rule-based logic but offer less flexibility for custom AI. The request was for *AI*, so the API route is more appropriate, but be aware of these platform options.
3.  **Version Control:** Use Git (and GitHub/GitLab) from the start, even if it's just you.

**Phase 3: Core Development (Focus: MVP Loop)**

1.  **API Wrapper:** Create basic functions to interact with the Deriv API:
    *   `connect()`
    *   `get_market_data(instrument)`
    *   `place_order(instrument, direction, size, stop_loss, take_profit)`
    *   `get_open_positions()`
    *   `close_position(position_id)`
    *   `get_account_balance()`
    *   Implement robust error handling and logging for API calls.
2.  **Data Handling:**
    *   Function to fetch required historical data (for initial model training/backtesting if needed).
    *   Function to fetch real-time or near-real-time data for signal generation.
3.  **Signal Generation (AI Component):**
    *   Implement the chosen *simple* strategy logic.
    *   If using ML:
        *   Load pre-trained model (train it offline first based on historical data).
        *   Function to feed current market data into the model and get a prediction/signal (Buy, Sell, Hold).
4.  **Trading Logic:**
    *   The core loop: Fetch data -> Generate Signal -> Check Risk Rules -> Place Order (if signal valid and rules met).
5.  **Risk Management:**
    *   *Hard-code* essential risk rules:
        *   Maximum position size per trade.
        *   Mandatory stop-loss for every trade.
        *   Maximum concurrent open trades (start with 1).
        *   Basic checks on account balance.
6.  **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging:
    *   API interactions (requests/responses).
    *   Signals generated.
    *   Orders placed/filled/rejected.
    *   Errors encountered.
    *   Account balance changes.

**Phase 4: Testing (Focus: Safety & Demo Account)**

1.  **Backtesting (Simplified):** If your strategy allows, perform basic backtesting using historical data to get a *rough idea* of performance. Don't spend excessive time perfecting this for the MVP.
2.  **UNIT TESTING:** Test individual functions (API calls, signal generation, risk checks).
3.  **FORWARD TESTING (CRUCIAL):**
    *   Deploy the bot on your chosen server (VPS).
    *   Run it **exclusively on the Deriv DEMO account.**
    *   Monitor closely for:
        *   Correct order execution.
        *   Stop-loss/take-profit triggering as expected.
        *   Error handling performance.
        *   Resource usage (CPU/memory) on the server.
    *   Run for a significant period (days/weeks) to observe behavior in different market conditions. **Do not rush this step.**

**Phase 5: Deployment (MVP Live - Minimal Risk)**

1.  **Review Demo Performance:** Only proceed if demo trading is stable, executes as designed, and you understand its behavior.
2.  **Final Checks:**
    *   Secure API Keys (use environment variables or secure key management, NOT hard-coded).
    *   Ensure logging is working correctly.
    *   Review resource usage.
3.  **Initial Live Deployment:**
    *   Switch API keys to your LIVE Deriv account.
    *   **Start with the absolute minimum possible trade size.**
    *   Consider reducing the frequency or aggressiveness of the bot initially.
    *   Your goal here is *not profit*, but to verify the technical operation with real money and real-world latency/slippage.

**Phase 6: Monitoring & Iteration (Continuous)**

1.  **Intense Monitoring:** Closely watch:
    *   Live trades and P/L.
    *   Server status (uptime, resources).
    *   Logs for any errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   Deriv platform status or announcements.
2.  **Iteration:** Based on monitoring and performance (even minimal risk live performance):
    *   Fix bugs immediately.
    *   Refine the strategy (if necessary and carefully).
    *   Improve risk management rules.
    *   Gradually consider increasing trade size *only* after proven stability and performance (and if it aligns with your risk tolerance).
    *   Consider adding more sophisticated AI/features *later*, after the MVP is stable.

**Achieving "Fast":**

*   **Simplify Scope:** The most crucial factor. MVP means *minimum*.
*   **Use Standard Tools:** Leverage existing libraries (Python, scikit-learn).
*   **Focus on Core Loop:** Get Data -> Signal -> Risk Check -> Execute working reliably first.
*   **Prioritize Demo Testing:** It confirms functionality without real risk, allowing faster *safe* iteration.
*   **Defer Complexity:** Advanced AI, multiple strategies, complex risk management come *after* the stable MVP.
